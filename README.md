## Challenge 1: Checkerboard
This challenge required us to create a javaFX + Scenebuilder 2.0 application that would fill in a checkerboard and be dynamically sized with the window.
The menu contains options for changing the grid dimensions as well as board colors.

## Challenge 3: Checkerboard Data Model
This challenge required us to think about how we would implement a data model for the checkers game so that UI elements would not have to be used to determine the state of the game.
